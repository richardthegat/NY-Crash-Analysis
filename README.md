This project analyzes New York City motor vehicle collision data to identify trends that contribute to crashes. This analysis includes data cleaning, time series analysis to understand trends over time (including the impact of COVID-19), and geospatial techniques to identify high-risk areas. The project was submitted to the National Student Data Corps and eventually sent to the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. 

Documents:

Motor_vehicle_Collision.csv(too large to be uploaded): This is the document I used to conduct the analytics. It contains data on the crashes in the state–including but not limited to crash date, time, location, vehicle type, etc. 

ny_crash_analysis.py: Python code that makes use of libraries to conduct basic analytics, time series and geospatial analysis, and more on the Motor Vehicle Collisions csv. 

NY Crashes.pdf: These document contains visualizations made using power BI. It shows the number of crashes broken down by borough (Brooklyn has the highest), the top contributing factors (driver inattention is the leading cause), and the most common vehicle types involved (sedans and station wagons).

Yesufu, Oluwanifemi’s NY Crash Project.pdf: This PDF outlines the project's objectives, methodology, and findings. It emphasizes that crashes are often caused by human error, concentrated in urban areas, and peak during rush hour. It recommends targeted interventions, driver education, and infrastructure improvements.

NY crash Analysis Certificate: Certificate given to participants who have successfully met the requirements of the project.
